## About

**Six's Pong 3JS** is a 3D reinterpretation of the classic **Pong**, built with **Three.js**.

The project was inspired by  
[pong-do-morgs](https://github.com/schaldach/pong-do-morgs), created by my friend  
[@schaldach](https://github.com/schaldach).

The main goal was to explore Three.js in practice — experimenting with 3D rendering, movement, collision, and basic physics logic in a browser environment.  
It started as a learning exercise and quickly became a fun sandbox during college.
